## Keras implementation

#### Load test data

### Define keras model

### Examine weights

### Compile & train the model

### Make predictions

## Own implementation

#### Define sigmoid function

### Define our own dense layer (with and without np.mat_mul

### Create our sequential network

### Make predictions
